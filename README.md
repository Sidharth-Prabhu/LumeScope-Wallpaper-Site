### Key points:
- The **Demo Video** section uses a GitHub-friendly video link (you can upload the `.mp4` file directly in your repo or README editor, and GitHub will host it).  
- The **Preview Image** shows a static screenshot (use a 1200Ã—630px collage for best results).  
- All folders and features are clearly documented so anyone can set it up.

If you want, I can also **embed the video as an HTML `<video>` tag** inside the README so it plays inline instead of being a link. That looks flashier for GitHub.  
Do you want me to set it up like that?
